                <p>Hello, my name is Reid Burns. I've lived in Okinawa, Japan for over 18 years and consider it home. I can still speak, read, and write Japanese even though 
                I've forgotten so much since moving to the states 4 years ago. 
                <br>
                 On a side note, you probably know more about anime than I do. As a hobby I love working on cars, more specifically drifting. 
                One of my long-term goals is to start a programming career overseas</p>
